# Quizlet Live Cheat

This is a Tampermonkey userscript that lets you instantly answer questions in Quizlet live.

## Features

Right now this is pretty bare-bones. After joining a game, a hud will appear with two buttons. The hud can be toggled with "\\" (backslash).

#### Answer a Question

This will answer the question you're given, provided you're the one with the answer.

#### Auto Answer Questions

This will automatically answer questions as soon as they're available. Be warned: in indidual mode, this means you'll instantly win in a matter of seconds, since it ignores the cooldown you'd typically have.

## Installation

To install, click on [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheLazySquid/QuizletLiveCheat/main/build/bundle.user.js) while having [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net) installed.

### This script does not work on Firefox, due to limitations.

Presumably, this works on all chromium based browsers, but I have only tested Chrome and Edge.
