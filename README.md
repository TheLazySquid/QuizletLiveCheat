# Quizlet Live Cheat

This is a Tampermonkey userscript that lets you instantly answer questions in Quizlet live.

## Features

After joining a game, a hud will appear with several options. The hud can be toggled with "\\" (backslash).

#### Answer Question

This will answer the question you're given, provided you're the one with the answer.

#### Show Answer

This will pop up a display with the correct answer, to use yourself or give to teammates.

#### Help Mode

There are 4 different help modes:

1. None - Does Nothing
2. Auto Answer (instant) - will instantly answer questions the moment they are available to answer. This has no cooldown, and will win the game in seconds.
3. Auto Answer (wait) - will answer questions once they're ready to be answered.
4. Outline Correct Answer - If you have the correct answer, it will outline it in green and the others in red.

**Note about auto answer**:

Auto answer will only activate after a question is answered, be that with the button or by hand.
